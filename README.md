## Overview and Origin

* __What is the name of the company?__

Vanguard
  
* __When was the company incorporated?__

Vanguard group was founded in May of 1975 by John Bogle.

* __Who are the founders of the company?__

The founder of Vanguard is John Bogle.

* __How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?__

The idea for the Vanguard group (most commonly known as just Vanguard), was conceived whilst John Bogle was employed with the Wellington Management Co. Mr. Bogle became interested in index funds when he learning about the *Standard & Poors*. Bogle was eventually promoted to Chairman at Wellington, only to make an investment decision that decidely ended his role at the company. Precending this blunder he was not allowed to manage money within the company anymore. His curiousity grew from there, and he decided he wanted to make his own index fund. He found ETF's to more safe and allowed the customer to invest in the sector itself, instead of just stock in a company. Not long after Boyle would create a new type of account that he did not have to manage. It wasn't long before Bogle had created the _First Index Investment Trust_ in 1976. This was essentially the antecedent to the **Vanguard 500**.
 
* __How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?__

The company is funded mainly by two seperate classes: Investment funds, and Admiral funds. The latter usually will have a lower cost of expense, yet the minimun investment will generally be higher than the assets put into the investment funds. Since Vanguard does not have a owner, (and is instead owned by the shareholders) the investments generated by the shareholders is equal to the amounts of fund the Vanguard group has. As of 2022 Vanguard had $8.1 trillion dollars in funding.

## Business Activities

* __What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?__

Vanguard looks to help the common investor, by introducing a much more risk adverse option, ETF's. ETF's are less risky to the investor because you are not investing in a single stock/company. ETF's are anchored in a specific market or sector; instead of choosing which stock an aspiring investor would like the most in the technology sector, you could just invest in the sector itself.

* __Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?__

Vanguard's targets every kind of investor, from a single individual to a corporation there is something that Vanguard can offer. The main attraction to Vanguard is their low cost plans. Vanguard offers some of the lowest fees in the market, and therefore makes the prospect of a retirement fund is significantly more palatable. Vanguard's Target Retirement Funds are a collection of ETF's that are offered by the company. The appeal to these Retirement Funds is that Vanguard makes the investing process easier by offering over ETF's instead of individual stocks. The low fees, combined with the less risky option of ETF's instead of stocks make setting up a retirement fund with the company an almost irresistable decision.

* __What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)__

  With Vanguard being the second biggest invesment bank in the world, (second to Blackrock) and offering over 3,500 ETFs Vanguard offers something almost no other company can. Low Fees. Most investment firms cannot afford to set their fees as low as Vanguard, and do not offer the same kind of exposure in the different options concerning ETFs. Long term investments are the core function of the company, and Vanguard has manipulated their fees and offerings to lure prospective investors.  

* __Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)__

To remain as one of the top investment banks in the world, Vanguard has no option but keep up with the latest finanacial technologies. Vanguard is currently using, but not limited: Robo-Advising, Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. Vanguard is using robo-advising successfuly by attracting customers that may not trust the human element part of investing. New investors who have more trust rooted in technology and the calculations they offer, will undoubtedly be interested in the use of a robo-advisor. Vanguard's robo-advisors survey the investor to get an idea of what type of investor it is dealing with. The advisor will determine the risk tolerance, strategy, how aggresive their tendencies are, etc. Vanguard is implementing blockchain technology as well to manage their index funds. Vanguard is working with Symbiont to refine the blockchain technology. By using blockchaing, employees will not need to go in manually and change anything with the CRSP (Center for Research in Security Prices), instead the CRSP will update every time anything is changed. The use of Artificial Intelligence is a new venture for every company in the financial industry. Vanguard intends to use artificial intelligence in tandem with machine learning technologies to ascertain what types of decisions should be made. 


## Landscape

* __What domain of the financial industry is the company in?__

Vanguard group is a major player in the investment management domain. Although the company is considered young, (being 48 years old), it has made tremendous strides in world of investment management. John Bogle had a mission to popularize index funds, and he more than succeeded in his endeavor. In less than half a century, Vanguard has already managed to become the second largest invesment company in not only the U.S., but the world. 

*__What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?__

There have been numerous trends and innovations in the investment banking domain in the last 5-10 years. The trends/innovations include, but are not limited to: Rapidly evolving artificial intelligence, Increased regulatory standards and practices, the integration and competition of new financial technologies, and the digital transformation of currency. Although there are ever-evolving technologies in the investment banking domain, these have the biggest impact in the industry.

* __What are the other major companies in this domain?__

    The major companies that compete with the Vanguard group in the investment managemnt domain are: Blackrock, Fidelity, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Wealthfront, Franklin Templeton, T. Rowe Price, Merril Lynch, TIAA, and Edward Jones. 


## Results

* __What has been the business impact of this company so far?__

    Vanguard has undoubtedly become a titan in the invesment banking industry. The business' success is predicated on a the expertise in the field of index funds, that of which Vanguard helped popularize. The success of the index funds introduced by Vanguard had another important catalyst, low transaction fees. The ability to offer such low fees is a problem for other companies that also occupy the domain. The advantage that Vanguard has over other companies has resulted in an phenomenon called the "Vanguard" effect; this effect happens when Vanguard enters a market and other companies are faced with competing against the low fees offered. Most businesses in turn begin to reduce their prices. Vanguard is such a market making industry that other companies have no recourse but to attune their own policies.
  
* __What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?__

    Vanguard uses many metrics to asses their success. The most important metrics for Vanguard are similar to any investment bank, they include: 30 day yield, total return, and expense ratios. The 30 day yield applies to index funds, it tries to predict the future return on the security in the next 30 days. The 30 day yield sometimes isn't the most reliable data set, since it relies on the past 30 days to predict the next 30 days. This makes prospective news and speculation a non-factor. Total return is the metric that most customers and investors care about. The total return is determined by adding the price of shares and the value of any payouts received. When calculatin total return, it is assumed that any and all payouts are re-invested. Lastly, expense ratios are an integral metric when it comes to investments. Expense ratios measure the dollar amount paid out annually to the operators, including: fund managers, operating expense, overhead fees, etc. , usually represented in a percentage. 

* __How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?__

  Vanguard has performed historically very well when compared to its' primary competitors. Vanguard's dominance in the investment banking sector can be attributed to their ability to remain one of the top investment banks in the world. Vanguard posseses this ability because of their unique business model. Since Vanguard is owned by the shareholders, and isn't managed by a firm, the expense ratios offered can be incredibly low compared to the competition. Operating at cost, and allowing the investors to reap all the profits makes. Operating at such a low cost positively contributes to all other metrics measured.
## Recommendations

* __If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)__

  If I were an advisor for the Vanguard group, I would personally advocate for more research and development when it comes to technology, especially financial technology. Even though Vanguard is one of the most successful and funded companies in the world, it still lacks in the technology department. The main competitor to Vanguard is Blackrock, which specializes more in holding assets among other things. Blackrock is considered one of the best companies when it comes to analytical tools and Vanguard is often lagging behind. 

* __Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?__

  I think that Vanguard should invest more into their research and development team would increase growth immensely. If Vanguard were to invest and research more into financial models and technology that helps advise investors. Vanguard has implemented robo-advisors, but that is not sufficient measure alone.
  
* __What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?__

  The technologies that would need to be utilized to have the most profound effect would be data analytical models. Vanguard already being a market maker is why expanding the services offered is so imperative. If they remained stagnant, there would be no success in their future. Perfecting these models and integrating them into their own robo-advisors.

* __Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?__

  These technologies would be appropriate because it would be the best way to expand services. Vanguard already has the analytical tools to provide investment practices that their clients find suitable. Although Vanguard has dominated the low-cost, ETF markets, it is necessary to branch the services offered. A robo-advisor is an effective low cost solution, when compared to the use of human labor for the same services.

* __Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?__

  Offering more invesment options and working with individuals to set up more diverse portfolios. Vanguard has ETF's that no other company can compete with, when it comes to expense ratios and fees. Vanguard has proven it can offer better services through their continued success.

* __What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?__

 Manipulating robo-advisors into offering additional sustainable invesment practices besides the tried and true ETF and low cost business model would affect any share holders. The addition of more personal and specialized stock advisement would lead to an increase in earnings per customer. Vanguard offers one of the safest invesment strategies in the market, however, if they could add another option with a slightly higher risk, the investor may be more interested in taking chances they wouldn't with other companies.

* __Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?__

  These technologies, and integration of the newer analytical models into the pre-existing robo-advisors would profoundly affect the way that Vanguard competes for investors. Giving Vanguard an essential tool moving forward that they may expand upon as technology continues to evolve. This edge would increase company profits and increase the amount of investors.
