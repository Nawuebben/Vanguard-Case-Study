Bogle was eventually promoted to Chairman at Wellington, only to make an investment decision that decidely ended his role at the company. Precending this blunder he was not allowed to manage money within the company anymore. His curiousity grew from there, and he decided he wanted to make his own index fund. He found ETF's to more safe and allowed the customer to invest in the sector itself, instead of just stock in a company.
